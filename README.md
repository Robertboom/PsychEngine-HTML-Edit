# Friday Night Funkin' - Psych Engine HTML Optimization
An edited version of Psych Engine meant to optimize the HTML5 build to allow better performance on low end computers! This is a huge work in progress, so please be patient and expect bugs. The main goal for this edit is to provide an optimized framework of Psych Engine so that others can build upon it and customize it as they like.

Adding new features is not a major priority, but they will be added to the main branch. If you just want the regular source (with optimizations, obviously), then use the 'framework' branch.

## New Features/Optimizations
